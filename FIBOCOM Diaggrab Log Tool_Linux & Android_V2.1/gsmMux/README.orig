GSM 07.10 Driver Implementation with User Space Serial Ports

Copyright (C) 2003 Tuukka Karvonen <tkarvone@iki.fi>


Introduction

  This is an implementation of the GSM 07.10 protocol which makes use of the
  User Space Serial Ports (USSP). Only a subset of the GSM 07.10
  basic mode features are implemented so that the driver could be tested
  with Siemens MC35 module. 

  This work was done as a special assignment in Helsinki University of 
  Technology and the report of it is included as a pdf document. There
  are only short instructions for use in this README file. Please refer
  to the pdf document for more information on the driver.


Instructions for Use

  First you need to extract and compile the driver:

	tar -xvzf gsm0710.tar.gz
	cd gsm0710
	make

  The driver needs an USSP kernel module. The original USSP module was 
  modified to inform the daemon about modem signal changes. If you don't 
  have the USSP kernel module set up or you want to transfer modem signal 
  changes to the MS, you need to compile and install the USSP driver 
  included in the package. E.g.:

	su
	cd ussp
	make
	./mkdev.ussp
	insmod ./ussp.o
	exit

  Next you should check that your MS is ready for the multiplexer mode. 
  You can give required terminal settings and AT-commands e.g. with Minicom 
  serial communication program. In the mux mode characters are transmitted 
  in 8N1 mode. In addition to that Siemens MC3x/TC3x requires that AT+IPR is 
  not in auto mode, so you should type AT+IPR=57600, and also use of RTS/CTS 
  flow control is recommended.

  Then you can start the daemon. First make sure that you have rw-permissions 
  for the device /dev/ussp_ctl or /dev/misc/ussp_ctl in case of devfs and for 
  the serial port that the MS is connected to. The driver command syntax is:

	gsm0710 <dev> [channels] [first_ttyU] [max_frame_size]

  where: 
  - dev is the device (e.g. /dev/ttyS0)
  - channels is the number of logical channels (defaults to 3)
  - first_ttyU is the number of first ttyU device 
               (defaults to 0 i.e. /dev/ttyU0)
  - max_frame_size is the maximum amount of information octets allowed in 
                   one frame (defaults to Siemens MC3x/TC3x limit i.e. 97. The 
                   default value specified in the GSM 07.10 specification 
                   would be 64 octets.)
  
  So if you have connected your Siemens MC3x/TC3x to the first serial port, 
  you could start the driver with command:

	./gsm0710 /dev/ttyS0

  The driver can be stopped by pressing CTRL-C, which terminates the 
  multiplexer session.
